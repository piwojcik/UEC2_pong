----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_vga/u_ball_controller/x_delta_nxt_reg[2]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_vga/u_ball_controller/x_delta_nxt_reg[2]/L3_2/O, cell u_top_vga/u_ball_controller/x_delta_nxt_reg[2]/L3_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_vga/u_ball_controller/y_delta_nxt_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_vga/u_ball_controller/y_delta_nxt_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell u_top_vga/u_ball_controller/y_delta_nxt_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
