----SYNTHESIS----
WARNING: [Synth 8-87] always_comb on 'char_line_reg' did not result in combinational logic [rtl/graphic/draw_state.sv:75]
WARNING: [Synth 8-3848] Net y_pad_right in module/entity top_vga does not have driver. [rtl/top_vga.sv:116]
WARNING: [Synth 8-87] always_comb on 'hor_ball_velocity_nxt_reg' did not result in combinational logic [rtl/logic/ball_controller.sv:105]
WARNING: [Synth 8-87] always_comb on 'ver_ball_velocity_nxt_reg' did not result in combinational logic [rtl/logic/ball_controller.sv:106]
WARNING: [Synth 8-327] inferring latch for variable 'char_line_reg' [rtl/graphic/draw_state.sv:75]
WARNING: [Synth 8-327] inferring latch for variable 'hor_ball_velocity_nxt_reg' [rtl/logic/ball_controller.sv:105]
WARNING: [Synth 8-327] inferring latch for variable 'ver_ball_velocity_nxt_reg' [rtl/logic/ball_controller.sv:106]
WARNING: [Synth 8-7080] Parallel synthesis criteria is not met
WARNING: [Synth 8-3332] Sequential element (u_top_logic/u_ball_controller/hor_ball_velocity_nxt_reg[2]) is unused and will be removed from module top_vga_basys3.
WARNING: [Synth 8-3332] Sequential element (u_top_logic/u_ball_controller/ver_ball_velocity_nxt_reg[2]) is unused and will be removed from module top_vga_basys3.

----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Clk expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Data expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Clk expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Data expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_vga/u_draw_ball_pads/u_delay_count/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_vga/u_draw_ball_pads/u_delay_count/char_line_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell u_top_vga/u_draw_ball_pads/u_delay_count/char_line_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_vga/u_vga_timing/timing_tick is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_vga/u_vga_timing/x_ball[10]_i_2/O, cell u_top_vga/u_vga_timing/x_ball[10]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
