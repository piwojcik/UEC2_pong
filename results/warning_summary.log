----IMPLEMENTATION----
<<<<<<< HEAD
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_vga/u_vga_timing/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_vga/u_vga_timing/y_ball_nxt_reg[9]_i_2/O, cell u_top_vga/u_vga_timing/y_ball_nxt_reg[9]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
