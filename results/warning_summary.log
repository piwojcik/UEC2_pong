WARNING: [Synth 8-7080] Parallel synthesis criteria is not met
WARNING: [Synth 8-3332] Sequential element (u_top_logic/u_ball_controller/hor_ball_velocity_nxt_reg[1]) is unused and will be removed from module top_vga_basys3.
WARNING: [Synth 8-3332] Sequential element (u_top_logic/u_ball_controller/hor_ball_velocity_nxt_reg[0]) is unused and will be removed from module top_vga_basys3.

----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Clk expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Data expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Clk expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Data expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_logic/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_logic/char_line_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell u_top_logic/char_line_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_vga/u_vga_timing/hcount_reg[9]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_vga/u_vga_timing/x_ball[10]_i_2/O, cell u_top_vga/u_vga_timing/x_ball[10]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
