----SYNTHESIS----
WARNING: [Synth 8-3848] Net tx in module/entity keyboard_top does not have driver. [rtl/keyboard/keyboard_top.sv:38]
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port tx in module keyboard_top is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7080] Parallel synthesis criteria is not met
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port tx in module top_vga_basys3 is either unconnected or has no load

----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Clk expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Data expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
