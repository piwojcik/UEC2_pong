----SYNTHESIS----
WARNING: [Synth 8-87] always_comb on 'down_reg' did not result in combinational logic [rtl/logic/ball_controller.sv:56]
WARNING: [Synth 8-87] always_comb on 'right_reg' did not result in combinational logic [rtl/logic/ball_controller.sv:57]
WARNING: [Synth 8-327] inferring latch for variable 'right_reg' [rtl/logic/ball_controller.sv:57]
WARNING: [Synth 8-327] inferring latch for variable 'down_reg' [rtl/logic/ball_controller.sv:56]
WARNING: [Synth 8-7080] Parallel synthesis criteria is not met

----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Clk expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Data expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Clk expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port PS2Data expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_vga/u_vga_timing/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_vga/u_vga_timing/right_reg_i_2/O, cell u_top_vga/u_vga_timing/right_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
